        "exceptional algebra, while the super Chern-Simons matrix model is described by the free energy of topological "
        "strings on the del Pezzo background with the symmetry broken. We study the symmetry breaking of the quantum "
        "cousin of the algebraic curve and reproduce the results in the super Chern-Simons matrix model.",

        "We discuss in detail the distributions of energy, radial pressure and tangential pressure inside the nucleon. "
        "In particular, this discussion is carried on in both the instant form and the front form of dynamics. Moreover "
        "we show for the first time how these mechanical concepts can be defined when the average nucleon momentum does "
        "not vanish. We express the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and stability in terms of these two and "
        "three-dimensional energy and pressure distributions. We briefly discuss the phenomenological relevance of our"
        " findings with a simple yet realistic model. In the light of this exhaustive mechanical description of the "
        "nucleon, we also present several possible connections between hadronic physics and compact stars, like e.g. "
        "the study of the equation of state for matter under extreme conditions and stability constraints.",

        "indications of new physics. Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For "
        "each event class an automated search algorithm tests whether the data are compatible with the Monte Carlo "
        "simulated expectation in several distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. The significance of a "
        "deviation is quantified using pseudo-experiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines a "
        "signal region for a dedicated follow-up analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the "
        "data-derived signal regions on a new dataset allows a statistical interpretation without the large "
        "look-elsewhere effect. The sensitivity of the approach is discussed using Standard Model processes and "
